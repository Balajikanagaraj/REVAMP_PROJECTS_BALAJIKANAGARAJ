<hr> (for horizontal lines)

4.Difference Between Elements and Attributes
Elements: These are the basic building blocks of HTML and define the structure and content of a webpage.
For instance: <h1>Title</h1> includes <h1> as an element.
Attributes: These provide additional details or functionality to elements. They are placed inside the opening tag.
Example: <a href="https://example.com">Visit</a>, where the href attribute specifies the link's URL.

&gt; represents >
&amp; represents &
These are useful for embedding code snippets or displaying special characters.

Making a page responsive: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
